### 🔥 About Me
I build a **high-performance C++ game engine from scratch**, focusing on advanced rendering, system architecture, and runtime flexibility.
Right now, I am studying Unreal Engine and Unity to do my own game engine. My goal is to make this engine small, reliable and from from scratch.
Everything I do is designed for **efficiency, correctness, and real-time performance**, with a strong focus on modern C++ techniques.

---

### ⚙️ My Engine Highlights
- **Advanced Frame Graph** – Flexible and optimized rendering pipeline, with automatic barrier / semaphore placement
- **Custom Containers & ECS** – Tailored memory management and type-safe systems using **concepts**  
- **Lock-Free Job System** – Task priorities, smart work displacement, multithreading  
- **Hot-Reloading** – Assets, shaders, and scripts reload at runtime; powered by a Python + CMake build system. Allows
  some C++ code to be hot-reloaded too!
- **LLVM-Based Tooling** – clang, clang-tidy, clangd, and sanitizers ensure robustness and correctness  

---

### 🎯 Current & Upcoming Projects
- **Asset Manager & Virtual File System** – Async IO and hot-reloadable resources  
- **C# Scripting Integration** – Runtime script support for textures, shaders, and game logic  
- **Render Graph Visualization** – Driving first render outputs to explore my engine’s capabilities  
- **Star Smiths** - A 4X strategy game built on my engine, featuring fully customizable ships with modules, weapons, engines, and more. Players can take on the role of pilot, captain, commander—or all at once!
