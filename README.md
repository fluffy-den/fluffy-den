### 🔥 About Me
I create **high-performance C++ game engines from scratch**, with a focus on **advanced rendering, modular architecture, and runtime efficiency**.  
Currently, I’m exploring **Unreal Engine and Unity** to refine engine design, aiming for a **compact, reliable, fully custom engine**.  

Everything I build is driven by **efficiency, correctness, and real-time performance**, leveraging modern C++ techniques and thoughtful system design.

### ⚙️ Engine Highlights
- **Advanced Frame Graph** – Flexible, optimized rendering pipeline with automatic barrier and semaphore handling  
- **Custom Containers & ECS** – Type-safe, memory-efficient systems powered by **C++20 concepts**  
- **Lock-Free Job System** – Multithreaded task scheduling with priorities and smart work-stealing  
- **Hot-Reloading** – Runtime updates for assets, shaders, scripts, and partial C++ code  
- **Engine Modules System – "pypul"** – Python + CMake tool to generate libraries, tests, and executables with custom dependency management  
- **LLVM-Based Tooling** – clang, clang-tidy, clangd, and sanitizers ensure robustness and correctness

### 🎯 Current & Upcoming Projects
- **Asset Manager & Virtual File System** – Async IO with hot-reloadable resources  
- **C# Scripting Integration** – Runtime scripting for shaders, textures, and game logic  
- **Render Graph Visualization** – Interactive exploration of rendering stages and engine capabilities  
- **Star Smiths** – A 4X strategy game with fully modular ships, letting players act as pilot, captain, or commander
